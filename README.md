Pros & Cons of using ORM for SQL DB(postgresSQL, mySQL, etc), according to me at least
* The advantages 
    1. You don't need great understanding about database in general
    2. You can quickly create database
* The disadvantages
    1. You need to learn about your specific ORM you're using, which may change again in the future
    2. You don't really understand your Database inside out
    3. Raw SQL language is easier to use for complex cases
